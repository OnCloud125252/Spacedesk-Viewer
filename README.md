# Spacedesk-Viewer

My own settings for the spacedesk client that can be used offline

> Resources from [Liumeo](https://github.com/eagleoflqj "Liumeo's github page"),  Big thanks to him !

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> Unfortunately I haven't update this program for a long time so many of the dependencies are ***VERY*** outdated, that means it's nearly impossible to update the current program. I will consider rewriting whole program in the near future. Please be patient and wait for the update!
